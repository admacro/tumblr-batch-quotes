Oscar Wilde
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken
I can resist everything except temptation.
We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.
To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.
The truth is rarely pure and never simple.
True friends stab you in the front.
Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.
