Ana√Øs Nin
We travel, some of us forever, to seek other states, other lives, other souls.
We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.

You cannot save people, you can only love them.
We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect.
Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country.
How wrong it is for a woman to expect the man to build the world she wants, rather than to create it herself.
There are many ways to be free. One of them is to transcend reality by imagination, as I try to do.
