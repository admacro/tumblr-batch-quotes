Carl Jung
Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.
Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.
Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darknesses of other people.
The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.
The pendulum of the mind alternates between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong.
There is no coming to consciousness without pain.
As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light of meaning in the darkness of mere being.
In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.
Every form of addiction is bad, no matter whether the narcotic be alcohol or morphine or idealism.
We cannot change anything until we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses.
